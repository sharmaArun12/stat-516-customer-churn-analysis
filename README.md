# Customer Churn Prediction Analysis (MATH 516)

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using multiple machine learning and statistical models. The goal is to compare model performance across different approaches and understand how model complexity impacts predictive accuracy on tabular data.

## Models Implemented

The following models were used in this project:

- Logistic Regression (R)
- XGBoost (Python)
- FT-Transformer (Python)

These models represent increasing levels of complexity, from simple linear methods to advanced deep learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**, which contains customer-level information such as:

- Demographics  
- Services subscribed  
- Account details  
- Billing information  

The dataset is included in this repository:


data/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv

## Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using:

- ROC-AUC  
- PR-AUC  
- Brier Score  
- F1 Score  

A classification threshold of 0.3 was used to better identify churn cases.

## Results Summary

| Model                | ROC-AUC | PR-AUC | Brier Score | F1 Score |
|---------------------|--------:|-------:|------------:|---------:|
| Logistic Regression | 0.8557  | 0.6743 | 0.1314      | 0.6399   |
| XGBoost             | 0.8388  | 0.6676 | 0.1575      | 0.5857   |
| FT-Transformer      | 0.8485  | 0.6601 | 0.1364      | 0.6187   |

Logistic Regression achieved the best overall performance across all metrics. While XGBoost and FT-Transformer captured more complex feature interactions, they did not outperform the simpler linear model on this dataset.
